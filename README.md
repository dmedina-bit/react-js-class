## Challenges
- Write a new the AppCustom.js file from scratch + have your index.js file serve that instead of App.js
    - HINT: don't forget to import your new AppCustom.js file
    - Repetition is key...don't be lazy on these!
- Make a new class in the App.css file and use it in the App.js component
    - HINT: look at the className in the div tag
- Add a new component called AboutMe with your name and some information about you + use it in your AppCustom.js
    - HINT: this is the same flow as our HelloWord component
    - BONUS: use new HTML tags other than header and list to get a better feel for them
